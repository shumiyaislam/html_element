	<p><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base tag</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>


	

	<h1>The bdi element</h1>
	<p>In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of points in a contest.

	<ul>
 	   <li>User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points</li>
 	   <li>User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>: 80 points</li>
